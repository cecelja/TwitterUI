# TwitterUI
The task was to create a simple application that upon clicking on the main screen button presents a twitter - like UI which was created using the SnapKit 
library. The second task was to implement a Deep link mechanism which is capable of navigating from a browser to both app screens. 
Other than navigation the Deeplink can take a parameter and change the title in the twitter UI controller screen.
